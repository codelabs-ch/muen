2013-01-24 Ahven 2.3
====================

Changes
-------
	* Various procedure descriptions in the API documentation
	  were improved.
	* Character limit of long messages in test results have been
	  increased to 1024. On some compilers this means that
	  memory usage is over 1 kilobytes per test result.
	* New constant: Ahven.Max_Long_String_Len
	* Exception backtraces are now stored to test results
	  when test fails or has an error.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* TAP runner did not output multiline (long) messages correctly.
	  This is now fixed.

Internal
--------
	* New package: Ahven.Long_AStrings
	* Some coding style fixes.

Known issues
------------
	* On Fedora 17/18 you need to first install libgnat-static package:

	  sudo yum install libgnat-static

	  Otherwise GNAT will die with internal error when building Ahven.


2012-03-05 Ahven 2.2
====================

Changes
-------
	* GNAT 3.15p project files from contrib/gnat315p removed.
	* The code snippets in the documentation are now highlighted
	  as Ada code.
	* API documentation generation using Adabrowse is now deprecated.
	  The new way is to use Sphinx for document generation.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven.XML_Runner did not report skipped tests correctly.
	  This is now fixed. (The bug was similar to Ahven.Text_Runner
	  bug in Ahven 2.1.)

Internal
--------
	* Small test suite improvements.

2011-09-24 Ahven 2.1
====================

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven.Text_Runner did not report skipped tests correctly.
	  This is now fixed.

Internal
--------
	* Function Ahven.Results.Skipped_Count was added.

2011-09-23 Ahven 2.0
====================

Changes
-------
	* Tests can be now given a timeout value. If a test is not
	  executed in the given time, it is stopped and a timeout
          failure is reported. See '-t' option of the test runners.
	  The timeout feature depends on the possibility to abort
	  a task after a certain amount of time. If the task abortion
	  is not possible, the current test will continue running
	  even after the given timeout.

	* A test can be now skipped programmatically by calling
	  procedure Skip("Message"). A skipped test are considered
	  to be equal to passed tests, but depending on the test
	  runner, they can have extra "SKIP" information attached.

	* README is now provided in reStructured text format,
	  just like the manual.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven can be compiled on Fedora systems by installing
	  package "libgnat-static". Note: This was not a bug in
	  Ahven but a configuration issue on Fedora.

2011-04-19 Ahven 1.9
====================

Changes
-------
	* Manual was added to 'doc/manual/en' directory. It includes
          User's Guide section and API documentation. The documentation
          is written using reStructuredText and Sphinx 1.0, so Python
          and py-sphinx are required for building. API documentation
          generation via Adabrowse is still supported, but it will be
          deprecated and dropped later.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Extra Test'Class (...) type conversion was removed from
	  ahven-framework.adb. This allows compilation with GNAT GPL 2010.
	  (Bug bitbucket#3)

Internal
--------
	* Package Ahven.VStrings was replaced with an instantiation of
	  Ada.Strings.Bounded.Generic_Bounded_Length. This allowed us to
	  remove over 100 lines of code.

Known issues
------------
	* Ahven (or actually file ahven-parameters.adb) cannot be compiled
	  on Fedora 14 with gcc 4.5.1. See bug
          https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690610 for details.

2010-06-02 Ahven 1.8
====================

Changes
-------
	* The dynamic library support with GNAT was removed since
	  it did not work automatically in a trouble-free way on
	  Debian, Fedora, and Windows.

	* Ada.Calendar dependency was removed from Ahven.Framework.
	  Equivalent functionality is now implemented in
	  the test runners.

	* Support for TAP 1.3 was dropped. TAP 1.2 is supported
	  normally.
	
	* Janus/Ada 3.1.1d support was dropped. Ahven now requires
	  Janus/Ada 3.1.2beta or newer.

	* There is now ahven.spec file in contrib/fedora to
	  make packaging and installing Ahven easier on Fedora.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* If user placed a dynamically allocated Test_Case into
	  a statically allocated Test_Suite the finalization
	  procedure tried to release the same memory twice.
	  This is now fixed by implementing Adjust for the
	  Test_Suite type. (Bug bitbucket#2)

	* Many Some_Type'(initial values) expressions were
	  changed into more simpler (initial values) form.
	  This was done to avoid Janus/Ada bug no 73.

Internal
--------
	* Code cleanup: style fixes, removal of compiler warnings
	  and comment clarifications.

	* Remove_All procedure from Ahven.SList package was renamed
	  to Clear. The new name is more consistent with Ada.Containers
	  naming style.

	* Ahven.VStrings package now depends on Ada.Strings.Fixed.

	* Ahven.Framework.Indefinite_Test_List has no longer
	  procedures or functions for Cursors. Same functionality
	  can be now achieved using generic For_Each procedure.

2009-09-14 Ahven 1.7
====================

Changes
-------
	* The source code repository and the issue tracker are
	  now hosted at Bitbucket, http://bitbucket.org/tkoskine/ahven

	* The usage of Unbounded_String was completely removed
	  from all packages. Now Ahven.Framework.Get_Name function
	  returns String.

	* GNAT project files (.gpr) were moved to the 'gnat' directory.

	* The upper limit (Count_Type'Last) of Ahven.SList
	  is now documented.

	* A PDF report generation example from XML result files
	  was added to 'contrib/docbook-testreport'. From Reto Buerki.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Fix Contraint_Error when one tries to truncate
	  overlong string. Bug report and patch from Reto Buerki.
	  (Bug bitbucket#1)

	* XML_Runner now filters special characters like space or /
	  from the filenames. Patch from Reto Buerki.

Internal
--------
	* Makefile now has 'tags' target for generating 'tags' file.
	  It assumes that ctags utility has support for Ada.

	* It is no longer necessary to have procedure or function
	  declarations for all procedures and functions. The purpose
	  is to allow somewhat shorter code.

	* User's Guide has seen some progress, but it is still not
	  completely ready. (=one should not rely on it.)

	* In the test code, some Assert calls were converted to
	  more compact Assert_Equal calls.

2009-02-28 Ahven 1.6
====================

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Installation scripts for GNAT were fixed.
	  Bug report and patch from Reto Buerki.

2009-02-23 Ahven 1.5
====================

Changes
-------
	* Ahven is now hosted at sourceforge.net. New URLs are:
	  Project page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ahven
	  Home page:    http://ahven.sourceforge.net/

	* Janus/Ada build system was rewritten. See README for details.
	  Also, some minor changes were done to GNAT build scripts.

Bug fixed
---------
	* API documentation was not generated for the Ahven.SList package.

2009-01-22 Ahven 1.4
====================

Changes
-------
	* Type Ahven.Framework.Test_Result and related code was removed.
	  Ahven.Framework.Execute now takes Listeners.Result_Listener'Class
	  directly instead of Test_Result object.

	* New abstract function Test_Count was added to the Test type.
	  The function returns the amount of test routines which will
	  be executed when the Run procedure is called.

	* Test Anything Protocol (TAP) support: There is now a new
	  Ahven.Tap_Runner package, which outputs test results in
	  TAP format (versions 1.2 and 1.3 are supported).

	* Get_Message and Get_Long_Message functions now return String
	  instead of Unbounded_String.

	* The GNAT project files for GNAT 3.15p were synchronised
	  with the GNAT GPL versions.

	* Janus/Ada build scripts are now in the 'janusada' directory
	  instead of 'contrib\janusada'.

	* New (generic) assertion procedure:
	    Assert_Equal (Expected, Actual, Message).
	  Suggestion and the source code from Pawel Plazienski.

	* New procedure for inserting stack-allocated tests into test suites:
	    Add_Static_Test (Suite, T).
	  Idea from Pawel Plazienski.

	* Internally, almost all Unbounded_Strings were converted into
	  VStrings. This limits the maximum length of test names and
	  failure messages to 160 characters. Constraint_Error is
	  raised for overlong test names and too long failure messages
	  are silently truncated into 160 characters.
	  This was done for better Janus/Ada 3.1.1d compatibility.

Bugs fixed
-----------
	* Text-based test runner results are now aligned in a better way.
	  Fix for bug #12220.

Internal
--------
	* All lists were converted into singly linked lists. Lists were
	  made generic wherever possible.

	* Listeners.Output_Capture was combined into Listeners.Basic.

2008-08-13 Ahven 1.3
====================

Changes
-------
	* Example configuration for Cruisecontrol was added.

	* The GNAT project file for GNAT 3.15p was added. 

	* Fix for bug #12165 and make test suite to work
	  with Janus/Ada 3.1.x.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* The API documentation is now generated also for
	  the Ahven.Compat and Ahven.XML_Runner packages.

	* The use of System.Address_To_Access_Conversions was removed.
	  This allows Ahven to be compiled with Janus/Ada.
	  At the same time, Ahven.Framework.Run (T : Test;...)
	  was changed back to Ahven.Framework.Run (T : in out Test;...).
	  Sorry for the inconvenience.

	* Non-standard pragmas were removed. The code should compile
	  now on multiple Ada compilers without warnings about
	  unrecognised pragmas.

Internal
--------
	* Variable "OS" in Makefile and GNAT project files was renamed
	  to "OS_Version".

	* New tests:
	    Result_Tests.Test_Add_{Pass,Failure,Error},
	    Framework_Tests.Test_Tear_Down,
	    Ahven.Result_Listener_List.Test_Append.

	* Removed tests: List_Tests.*.

	* Code cleanups:
	  + Duplicate code from Text_Runner.Run and XML_Runner.Run
	    moved into Runner.Run_Suite.
	  + Duplicate code from various Framework.Run procedures was
	    moved into Framework.Run_Internal.

	* Ahven.Doubly_Linked_List was removed. This is related
	  to bug #12165.

2008-05-12 Ahven 1.2
====================

Changes
-------
	* New XML_Runner which generates JUnit compatible XML test results.
	  XML_Runner can be either run explicitly or via Text_Runner
	  using the '-x' parameter.

	* Unused access types Test_Access, Test_Case_Class_Access,
	  Test_Case_Access, Test_Suite_Class_Access, Result_Listener_Access,
	  Test_Command_Access, Test_Object_Command_Access,
	  Basic_Listener_Access, and Output_Capture_Listener_Access removed.

	* Ahven.Framework.Run (T : in out Test;...) is changed to
	  Ahven.Framework.Run (T : Test;...), because 'in out' mode
	  was not necessary.

	* New procedures/functions:
	    Ahven.Text_Runner.Run (Suite : Framework.Test_Suite'Class);
	    Ahven.Framework.Create_Suite return Test_Suite;
	  With these, the suite can be created on stack and one does not
	  need to play with access types.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven can be now compiled with GNAT 3.15p.

	* The GNAT project file should work on Windows again.

Internal
--------
	* XML_Runner introduced a need for some platform specific files.
	  Therefore, 'src' directory now contains subdirectories 'unix'
	  and 'windows'.

	* New tests: Result_Tests.Test_*

	* Next_* procedures for in the Results package were replaced
	  with proper iterators.

2008-01-30 Ahven 1.1
====================

Changes
-------
	* The Ahven.Framework and the test runners are able to optionally
	  run only the tests which match the given name.

	* The default Text_Runner is able to capture Ada.Text_IO output
	  from a test into a temporary file and show the output if
	  the test does not pass.
	  Option '-c' turns the capture feature on.

	* The default Text_Runner shows the exception message in addition
	  to the exception name when the test ends in error.
	  (Idea and original patch from Alexander Senier)

	* The default Text_Runner is now able to provide a short summary
	  instead of full test report.
	  Use option '-q' to get the test summary.

	* The GNAT project file is now called 'ahven.gpr' instead of
	  old 'ahven_lib.gpr'.

	* ALI files (*.ali) are now installed read-only, so GNAT
	  does not try to rebuild the library.
	  (Patch from Alexander Senier)

	* Function Ahven.Framework.Name is renamed
	  to Ahven.Framework.Get_Name.

	* Shared library produced by GNAT now includes the version number.

Internal
--------
	* New listener: Output_Capture_Listener, which will
	  forward Ada.Text_IO output into a temporary file.

	* Type Ahven.Results.Result_Place is renamed to
	  Ahven.Results.Result_Info.

	* Ahven.Double_Linked_List is renamed to Ahven.Doubly_Linked_List,
	  because other Ada linked list implementations also use
	  similar naming scheme.

	* AdaControl is used to enforce some parts of the coding style.
	  This caused some API changes, but in most cases the changes
	  are invisible.

2007-10-24 Ahven 1.0
====================
Initial release.

Ahven is a simple unit test library for Ada 95.
It is modeled after JUnit and some ideas are
taken from AUnit. Ahven 1.0 is distributed under
ISC license.

Features
========
* Test, Test_Case, and Test_Suite classes (tagged types)
* Assert and Fail procedures for triggering assertion failures
