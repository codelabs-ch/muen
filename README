The Muen Separation Kernel
==========================

The Muen Separation Kernel is the world's first Open Source microkernel that
has been formally proven to contain no runtime errors at the source code level.
It is developed in Switzerland by https://www.codelabs.ch[codelabs GmbH].
Muen was designed specifically to meet the challenging requirements of
high-assurance systems on the Intel x86/64 platform. To ensure Muen is suitable
for highly critical systems and advanced national security platforms, codelabs
closely cooperates with the high-security specialist secunet Security Networks
AG in Germany.

A Separation Kernel (SK) is a specialized microkernel that provides an
execution environment for components that exclusively communicate according to
a given security policy and are otherwise strictly isolated from each other.
The covert channel problem, largely ignored by other platforms, is addressed
explicitly by these kernels. SKs are generally more static and smaller than
dynamic microkernels, which minimizes the possibility of kernel failure,
enables the application of formal verification techniques and the mitigation of
covert channels.

Muen uses Intel's hardware-assisted virtualization technology VT-x as core
mechanism to separate components. The kernel executes in VMX root mode, while
user components, so called 'subjects', run in VMX non-root mode. Hardware
passthrough is realized using Intel's VT-d DMA and interrupt remapping
technology. This enables the secure assignment of PCI devices to subjects.

NOTE: Muen is under active development and verification of kernel properties is
      ongoing.


Features
--------

Kernel
~~~~~~
The following list outlines the most-prominent features of the Muen kernel:

* Minimal SK for the Intel x86/64 architecture written in SPARK 2014
* Full availability of source code and documentation
* Proof of absence of runtime errors
* Multicore support
* Nested paging (EPT) and memory typing (PAT)
* Fixed cyclic scheduling using Intel VMX preemption timer
* Static assignment of resources according to system policy
* PCI device passthrough using Intel VT-d (DMAR and IR)
* PCI config space emulation
* Support for Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI)
* Minimal Zero-Footprint Run-Time (RTS)
* Event mechanism
* Shared memory channels for inter-subject communication
* Crash Audit
* Support for 64-bit native and 32/64-bit VM subjects
  - Native 64-bit Ada subjects
  - Native 64-bit SPARK 2014 subjects
  - Linux 32/64-bit VMs
  - SMP for Linux VMs
  - Genode x86_64 base-hw system <<genode>>
  - Windows 32-bit VMs
  - MirageOS unikernels <<mirageos>>

Muen supports the hardware-accelerated virtualization of Microsoft Windows
through the use of a fully de-privileged variant of VirtualBox <<vbox>> running
inside a strongly isolated VM subject on top of Genode's base-hw kernel. See
the release notes of the Genode OS Framework version 16.08 <<genode_muen>> for
more information about this exciting feature.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~
The Muen platform includes re-usable components which implement common services:

* Device Manager (DM) written in SPARK 2014
* Subject Monitor (SM) written in SPARK 2014
* Subject Loader (SL) written in SPARK 2014
* Timeserver subject written in SPARK 2014
* Debugserver subject written in Ada 2012
* PS/2 driver subject written in Ada 2012
* Virtual Terminal (VT) subject written in Ada 2012

Furthermore the <<muenfs>>, <<muennet>> and <<muenblock>> Linux kernel modules
provide virtual filesystem, network interface and block I/O drivers based on
inter-subject memory channels.

Toolchain
~~~~~~~~~
The Muen platform includes a versatile toolchain which facilitates the
specification and construction of component-based systems in different
application domains.

The <<mugenhwcfg>> tool for automated hardware description generation
simplifies the addition of support for new target machines. Scheduling plans
can be generated automatically from a scheduling configuration using the
<<mugenschedcfg>> tool.

|===================================================================

The first step to build Muen is to install the required packages:

  $ sudo apt-get install acpica-tools bc binutils-dev bison flex git-core \
      gnuplot grub-pc-bin lcov libc6-dev libelf-dev libiberty-dev \
      libxml2-utils make qemu-system-x86 tidy wget xorriso xsltproc zlib1g-dev

The Ada and SPARK packages currently available in Debian and Ubuntu are too old
to build Muen. GNAT Community 2019 for x86 GNU Linux (64-bit) from AdaCore
must be installed instead. It can be downloaded from the following location:

  https://www.adacore.com/download

Extend your `PATH` to make the GNAT Community 2019 compiler and tools
visible to the Muen build system (assuming that they are installed below
`/opt`):

  $ export PATH=/opt/GNAT/2019/bin:$PATH

Docker
~~~~~~
There is also a ready-made Docker image which contains all necessary tools for
Muen development. You can install it using the following command:

  $ docker pull codelabsch/muen-dev-env

Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~
To build the Muen tools, RTS, kernel and example components change to the Muen
source directory and issue the following command:

  $ make

This will create an image containing the example system which can be booted by
any Multiboot <<mboot>> compliant bootloader.

The following command gives a short description of the top-level Makefile
targets:

  $ make help


Deploy
------
The build system provides two ways to instantly deploy and test the created
system image.

Emulation
~~~~~~~~~
To ease kernel development and testing, the Muen project makes use of nested
virtualization provided by QEMU/KVM. In order for this to work, a recent Linux
kernel (>= 5.2.0) with applied KVM GUEST_CR3 fix <<lnxcr3>> and the
`qemu-system-x86_64` binary must be installed on the build machine.

Issue the following command in the Muen project directory to start the nested
virtualization of a Muen system:

  $ make emulate

The system serial output is written to `emulate/serial.out`. Follow the
on-screen instructions on how to connect to the QEMU curses console or how to
SSH into the NIC Linux guest VM.

NOTE: As the virtual terminal (VT) over curses is timing sensitive and QEMU/KVM
cannot guarantee tick-exact timing depending on the host CPU and system load,
this console is just an emergency console. Use SSH to interact with the booted
Muen system.

Hardware
~~~~~~~~
The top-level Makefile provides two convenient targets to deploy Muen to real
hardware: `iso` and `deploy`. The first creates a bootable ISO image which can
be burned on a CD-ROM or dumped on a USB stick, the second uses network boot to
shorten round-trips during development.

USB Stick
^^^^^^^^^
To create a bootable USB stick containing the Muen system, enter the following
commands in the top-level directory:

  $ make HARDWARE=hardware/lenovo-t440s.xml SYSTEM=xml/demo_system_vtd.xml iso

Then follow the instructions on the screen.

Network Boot
^^^^^^^^^^^^
For fast deployment of the Muen system image to real hardware, the iPXE
<<ipxe>> boot firmware installed on a USB stick in conjunction with Intel Active
Management Technology (AMT) is used. Please refer to the amtterm <<amt>>
documentation on how to configure AMT on the target hardware.

To build and install iPXE with the Muen specific boot script issue the
following commands:

  $ sudo apt-get install liblzma-dev
  $ git clone git://git.ipxe.org/ipxe.git
  $ wget https://muen.sk/muen.ipxe
  $ cd ipxe/src
  $ make bin/ipxe.usb EMBED=../../muen.ipxe
  $ sudo dd if=bin/ipxe.usb of=/dev/sdX

The `/dev/sdX` device is the USB stick (e.g. `/dev/sdc`, without partition
number). *All existing data will be erased*.

When booting from the created stick the first NIC (net0) is configured as follows:

  IP Address : 192.168.254.2
  Netmask    : 255.255.255.0
  Gateway    : 192.168.254.1

After initialization of the network adapter iPXE tries to download and boot the
system image from the following URL:

  http://192.168.254.1:8000/muen.img

The development machine must be connected to the target hardware via an
interface with IP address 192.168.254.1. To actually serve the created system
image to the bootloader, issue the following command in the top-level Muen
directory:

  $ export AMT_PASSWORD=<your AMT password>
  $ make deploy

To view the output of the Muen kernel debug console use the command:

  $ amtterm 192.168.254.2

If your hardware differs from the default configuration, additionally specify
the `HARDWARE` variable:

  $ make deploy HARDWARE=hardware/intel-nuc-dc53427hye.xml
