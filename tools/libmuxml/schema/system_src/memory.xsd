    The \texttt{memoryType} specifies a physical memory region by name, size and
    caching.

    If no explicit physical address is specified for the region, the
    \texttt{mucfgalloc} tool will allocate a free one in usable memory, honoring
    the optional \texttt{alignment} attribute.

    A \texttt{reservedMemory} element is a special memory block declaration. It
    specifies a reserved memory region as outlined in the Intel VT-d
    Specification, "8.4 Reserved Memory Region Reporting Structure" (RMRR).

    Reserved memory regions are BIOS allocated memory ranges that may be DMA
    targets for certain legacy device use-cases. Devices that require access to
    such a region refer to it by name.

    See line \ref{lst:af-lineref-rmrr-block} in listing \ref{lst:annotated-policy}
    for an example RMRR element.

 <xs:simpleType name="subjectMemoryKindType">
  <xs:annotation>
   <xs:documentation>
    Subject memory type to categorize memory assigned to a subject. The
    validator tool checks that a subject only maps memory regions of types
    outlined in this section (\ref{validation-subj}).

    Also used by build tools to lookup certain elements by type. For example,
    the \texttt{mugenzp} tool looks for subject memory of type
    \texttt{subject\_zeropage} to process all Linux zero-pages in the policy.

    The following memory types are currently supported:

    % Use \texttt for memory types in list?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item subject~\\
    Unspecific subject memory, used e.g. for RAM regions of VM subjects.  The
    \texttt{mugenzp} tool used for Linux VMs (\ref{tools-mugenzp}) exports such
    regions as \texttt{E820\_RAM} in the ZP E820 memory map.
    \item subject\_info~\\
    Subject info (sinfo) region. Provided to all subjects in order to query
    information about the execution environment. The file backing of this region
    is created by the \texttt{mugensinfo} tool (\ref{tools-mugensinfo}).
    \item subject\_state~\\
    Subject register state. Mapped into the SK kernel executing the given
    subject, kernels running on other CPUs have no access. Accessible by subject
    monitors running on the same CPU if specified in the policy. Validator
    enforces that each subject has an associated \texttt{subject\_state} region
    and that it is mapped at the expected virtual address in the executing
    kernel (\ref{validation-subj}).
    \item subject\_binary~\\
    Subject executable as a whole or separate subject executable regions (text,
    rodata, data, bss, stack) with access rights (writable/executable). The
    \texttt{mucbinsplit} tool automatically creates a component
    \texttt{provides} section with separate binary regions and associated
    backing files from a component binary (\ref{tools-mucbinsplit}).
    \item subject\_channel~\\
    Physical memory region used as shared channel between two subjects. The
    expander tool transforms channels in system policy source format to memory
    regions with this type in system policy format A/B, as described in section
    \ref{system_src.xsd:channelsType}.
    \item subject\_crash\_audit~\\
    Memory region used by crash audit to store system crash information into
    slots, see \cite{muen:kernel_specification}. This information is preserved
    after a crash by performing a system warm start. Validators enforce that
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Region is present and uncached, \ref{validation-mem}
    \item Region does not overlap with image, \ref{validation-mem}
    \item Kernel mappings are present and correct, \ref{validation-knl}
    \item No subject has write access to this region, \ref{validation-subj}
    \end{itemize}
    \item subject\_initrd~\\
    Physical memory of this type designates an \emph{initial ramdisk}. This
    memory type is mostly used by Linux VMs. If multiple initrd regions are
    mapped into a subject, they must be adjacent (\ref{validation-subj}).

    The \texttt{mugenzp} tool (\ref{tools-mugenzp}) extracts the virtual address
    and size of a subject-mapped \texttt{subject\_initrd} region and stores the
    values in the generated Linux zero-page (ZP) backing file.
    \item subject\_bios~\\
    Indicates to subjects that the memory region is reserved for BIOS/firmware
    and must not be used as regular RAM.
    \item subject\_acpi\_*~\\
    Indicates to subjects that the memory region contains an ACPI table. See the
    ACPI specification for more information about RSDP, XSDT, FADT and DSDT ACPI
    tables. The \texttt{mugenzp} tool (\ref{tools-mugenzp}) exports such regions
    as \texttt{E820\_ACPI} in the ZP E820 memory map.
    \item subject\_zeropage~\\
    Indicates to Linux subjects that the memory region contains a zero-page. See
    the Linux kernel Zero Page documentation for more information.
    \item subject\_solo5\_boot\_info~\\
    Indicates to a VM running Solo5/Mirage that the memory region contains a
    boot info structure. The file-backing of such a region may be created using
    the \texttt{mugensolo5} tool (\ref{tools-mugensolo5}).
    \item subject\_device~\\
    Designates a memory region which is allowed to be added to a subject and a
    device domain. The difference to the \texttt{subject} memory type is that
    the region is not exported as \texttt{E820\_RAM} but \texttt{E820\_RESERVED}
    to Linux subjects. Therefore, such a region is useful to implement custom
    drivers without interference from Linux DMA zone handling.
    \item subject\_timed\_event~\\
    Region designates a subject timed event page, as described in
    \cite{muen:component_specification}. The expander tool creates a physical
    memory region for each subject and maps it into the associated subject and
    the SK kernel executing this subject.
