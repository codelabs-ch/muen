== The muen.sk Website

While the previous
link:#mirageos-unikernels[MirageOS Unikernels] article described how to build
and deploy MirageOS/Solo5 unikernels as subjects on Muen in general, this
article focuses on a practical use-case of the technology.

The https://muen.sk[muen.sk] project website is served by a MirageOS unikernel
running on Muen. The article explains how to build such a system using
https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/[multi-stage
Docker] images and then deploy it to actual hardware.

=== System Image Build
The following graph gives an overview of the muen.sk system image build
process:

image:graph_img_create.svg[Image creation, width=50%]

In order to be able to serve the page via the TLS stack provided by MirageOS,
up to date SSL/TLS certificates are required. We use
https://letsencrypt.org/[Letsencrypt] certificates for that purpose.

Therefore, the first step in the build process is to check whether the
currently deployed certificates are still valid. This is done using openssl:

```
openssl x509 -checkend 2592000 -noout -in certs/live/muen.sk/cert.pem
```

The command checks whether the certificate expires within 30 days. If renewal
is required, a new certificate is requested via the
https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#standalone[standalone feature] of the
Letsencrypt's certbot client. The certificate files are then added as content
of stage one in the multi-stage Docker build.

The complete Muen system image build consists of three Docker images:

. codelabsch/muen-website
. codelabsch/muen-mirageos
. codelabsch/muen-dev-env

These images can be found on our https://hub.docker.com/u/codelabsch/[Docker
Hub] page. The key is to import artifacts from the previous build stage into
the next one using the `COPY --from` syntax.  The following command gives an
example how to copy the generated site content from the website to the
unikernel stage:

```
FROM codelabsch/muen-website:latest as website-content
# generate website content

FROM codelabsch/muen-mirageos:latest as unikernel
COPY --from=website-content /home/writer/website-muen.sk/_site htdocs
```

The assembled Muen system image containing the unikernel subject serving the
generated website content is copied out of the final Docker container. Because
we want the target system to only boot cryptographically verified images, the
image is signed using the following command (as described by the
http://ipxe.org/crypto#code_signing[iPXE homepage]):

```
openssl cms -sign -binary -noattr -in $IMAGE -signer $SIGN_CERT \
  -inkey $SIGN_KEY -certfile $CA -outform DER -out $SIG
```

Then the image and associated signature is uploaded to a webserver which is
reachable by the target system.

=== iPXE Image Verification

In order to support image signature verification, the iPXE bootloader must be
compiled with the `IMAGE_TRUST_CMD` option enabled:

 //#define NEIGHBOUR_CMD                /* Neighbour management commands */

The following script instructs iPXE to only boot images which are deemed
trusted (i.e. which have a valid signature). Besides the general networking
setup steps, it fetches the Muen system image containing our MirageOS webserver
subject from a given URL and then verifies the associated signature. The
`imgstat` command is for debugging purposes and displays the current image
state before booting into the verified Muen system.

```
#!ipxe

imgtrust --permanent

ifopen net0
set net0/ip 192.168.199.4
set net0/netmask 255.255.255.0
set net0/gateway 192.168.199.1
set dns 192.168.199.1
imgfetch http://192.168.199.2/muen.img
imgverify muen.img http://192.168.199.2/muen.img.sig
imgstat
boot muen.img
```

The image is signed using a certificate issued by our own private CA. In order
for iPXE to successfully verify such a signature, we need to embed and trust
the appropriate certificates.  The `CERT` and `TRUST` environment variables can
be used for this:

```
make bin/ipxe.usb -j5 EMBED=muen.ipxe.website \
  DEBUG=open,x509 \
  CERT=ipxe-sign.crt,ca.crt \
  TRUST=ca.crt
```

This command compiles a bootable iPXE image which can be dumped onto an USB
stick. The certificates specified via `CERT` are embedded into the image. Since
embedded certificates are not automatically trusted, our CA must be specified
explicitly via the `TRUST` option.

CAUTION: Explicit `TRUST` disables the default trust in well-known CA
certificates. This is important to know if image fetching is intended via
HTTPS. The CA of the webserver certificate must be explicitly added to the
trusted certificates as well (if possible).

The `DEBUG` option is very helpful during initial testing if the image fetching
or signature verification step fails for some reason.

=== Deployment

The last step of the build process is to trigger a restart of the target system
via Intel AMT functionality. The target system restarts and performs the steps
depicted in the following graph:

image:graph_system_boot.svg[System boot, width=50%]

Your minimal, unikernel-based website should now be served at the configured IP
after system start.

In order to easily perform updates of the static Muen website with minimal
downtime, the whole aforementioned process is scripted.
