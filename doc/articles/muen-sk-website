== The muen.sk Website

While the previous
link:#mirageos-unikernels[MirageOS Unikernels] article described how to build
and deploy MirageOS/Solo5 unikernels as subjects on Muen in general, this
article focuses on a practical use-case of the technology.

The https://muen.sk[muen.sk] project website is served by the
https://github.com/hannesm/unipi[Unipi] MirageOS unikernel running on Muen.
Unipi fetches the static website content to serve from a Git repositry. The
article explains how to build such a system using
https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/[multi-stage
Docker] images and then deploy it to actual hardware.

=== System Image Build
The following graph gives an overview of the muen.sk system image build
process:

In order to be able to serve the page via the TLS stack provided by MirageOS,
up to date SSL/TLS certificates are required. We use
https://letsencrypt.org/[Letsencrypt] certificates for that purpose.

Therefore, the first step in the build process is to check whether the
currently deployed certificates are still valid. This is done using openssl:

```
openssl x509 -checkend 2592000 -noout -in certs/live/muen.sk/cert.pem
```

The command checks whether the certificate expires within 30 days. If renewal
is required, a new certificate is requested via the
https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#standalone[standalone feature] of the
Letsencrypt's certbot client. The certificate files are then added as content
of stage one in the multi-stage Docker build.

The complete Muen system image build consists of two Docker images:

. codelabsch/muen-mirageos
. codelabsch/muen-dev-env

These images can be found on our https://hub.docker.com/u/codelabsch/[Docker
Hub] page. The key is to import artifacts from the previous build stage into
the next one using the `COPY --from` syntax.  The following commands serve as
an example of how to copy the unikernel binary the MirageOS container to the
Muen system image build stage:

```
FROM codelabsch/muen-mirageos as unikernel
# compile unikernel

FROM codelabsch/muen-dev-env:latest
COPY --from=unikernel /home/opam/opam-repository/unipi/unipi.muen /tmp/unikernel
```

The assembled Muen system image containing the unikernel subject serving the
Muen website is copied out of the final Docker container. Because we want the
target system to only boot cryptographically verified images, the image is
signed using the following command (as described by the
http://ipxe.org/crypto#code_signing[iPXE homepage]):

```
openssl cms -sign -binary -noattr -in muen.iso -signer $SIGN_CERT \
  -inkey $SIGN_KEY -certfile $CA -outform DER -out $SIG

openssl cms -sign -binary -noattr -in memdisk -signer $SIGN_CERT \
  -inkey $SIGN_KEY -certfile $CA -outform DER -out $SIG
```

`memdisk` is a small kernel extracted from syslinux required to reliably boot
the ISO image via HTTP(S). The files and associated signatures are uploaded to
a webserver which is reachable by the target system.

=== iPXE Image Verification

In order to support image signature verification, the iPXE bootloader must be
compiled with the `IMAGE_TRUST_CMD` option enabled:

The following script instructs iPXE to only boot images which are deemed
trusted (i.e. which have a valid signature). Besides the general networking
setup steps, it fetches the `memdisk` kernel and the Muen system image
containing our MirageOS webserver subject from a given URL and then verifies
the associated signatures. The `imgstat` command is for debugging purposes and
displays the current image state before booting the verified Muen system.

```
#!ipxe

imgtrust --permanent

ifopen net0
set net0/ip 192.168.199.4
set net0/netmask 255.255.255.0
set net0/gateway 192.168.199.1

imgverify muen.iso http://192.168.199.2/muen.iso.sig
imgstat

imgargs memdisk iso raw
boot
```

The files are signed using a certificate issued by our own private CA. In order
for iPXE to successfully verify such a signature, we need to embed and trust
the appropriate certificates.  The `CERT` and `TRUST` environment variables can
be used for this:

```
make bin/ipxe.usb -j5 EMBED=muen.ipxe.website \
  DEBUG=open,x509 \
  CERT=ipxe-sign.crt,ca.crt \
  TRUST=ca.crt
```

This command compiles a bootable iPXE image which can be dumped onto an USB
stick. The certificates specified via `CERT` are embedded into the image. Since
embedded certificates are not automatically trusted, our CA must be specified
explicitly via the `TRUST` option.

CAUTION: Explicit `TRUST` disables the default trust in well-known CA
certificates. This is important to know if image fetching is intended via
HTTPS. The CA of the webserver certificate must be explicitly added to the
trusted certificates as well (if possible).

The `DEBUG` option is very helpful during initial testing if the image fetching
or signature verification step fails for some reason.

=== Deployment

The last step of the build process is to trigger a restart of the target system
via Intel AMT functionality. The target system restarts and performs the steps
depicted in the following graph:

image:graph_system_boot.svg[System boot, width=50%]

Your minimal, unikernel-based website should now be served at the configured IP
after system start.
